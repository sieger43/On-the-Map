# On the Map

This project is my rendition of the **On the Map** project for the [udacity.com](https://www.udacity.com) iOS Developer nano-degree. **On the Map** is the primary project for the *Network Requests and GCD* course.

The project is an app that shows a map. The map has information posted by other students where each information post is represented by a pin on a location. Tapping on the pin users display a URL that the student entered. The app user can type the name of a place that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and the user can also type a URL that he/she finds interesting.
